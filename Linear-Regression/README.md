## 🔍 What is Linear Regression?
Linear regression is one of the simplest and most popular algorithms in machine learning. It models the relationship between a dependent variable (target) and one or more independent variables (features) using a straight line:
  
\[
y = w_1x_1 + w_2x_2 + \dots + w_nx_n + b
\]

Where:
- \( y \): The predicted output
- \( x \): The input features
- \( w \): The weights (parameters)
- \( b \): The bias (intercept)
